# Blockchain Demo
A web-based demonstration of blockchain concepts.

[![Blockchain 101 - Demo](https://img.youtube.com/vi/_160oMzblY8/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_160oMzblY8)

This is a very basic visual introduction to the concepts behind a blockchain. We introduce 
the idea of an immutable ledger using an interactive web demo that is available here:
## Setup

Install dependencies:

```
cd blockchain-demo
npm install
```
Run the server:

```
npm start
```

OR

```
./bin/www
```
#For windows: if the above command didn't work, use this (make sure you have Node.js installed in your system):
```
node ./bin/www      
```

Point a web browser at the demo:

```
http://localhost:3000
```
